"""
Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. 
Your code should look something like this:
------------
car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')
print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')
------------
* Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each
line evaluates to True or False.
* Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate 
to True and another five tests evaluate to False.
